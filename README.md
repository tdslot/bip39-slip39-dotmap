### Reversed Mapping Explanation

Yoseyomo designed their system so that binary numbers are read intuitively, from left to right, starting with the smallest values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...), making it user-friendly. This "reversed" variant, available for both BIP39 and SLIP39, simplifies practical implementation, even though it varies slightly from the technical standard.

## BIP39 Dot Pattern Mapping

BIP39 is a standard for generating mnemonic recovery phrases (12-24 words) to recover private keys. It transforms private keys into easy-to-remember words.

### How BIP39 Works (Example: Word Index 628)

1.  **Find largest number ≤ 628:** 512.
2.  **Subtract:** 628 - 512 = 116.
3.  **Continue with next largest numbers:**
    *   **64:** 116 - 64 = 52.
    *   **32:** 52 - 32 = 20.
    *   **16:** 20 - 16 = 4.
    *   **4:** 4 - 4 = 0.
    *   Combination: **512 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 4 = 628**.

In the standard (non-reversed) mapping, binary numbers are read from left to right (largest to smallest value).

### Dot Pattern Representation (12 dots)

Each word is represented by 12 dots, corresponding to the values:
2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

For instance:

*   `#63 amazing = 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1`
    `| ○○○○ | ○○●● | ●●●● |`
*   `#977 key = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 1`
    `| ○○●● | ●●○● | ○○○● |`
*   `#996 ladder = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 4`
    `| ○○●● | ●●●○ | ○●○○ |`
*   `#997 lady = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 1`
    `| ○○●● | ●●●○ | ○●○● |`

This table divides the 12 points into three columns for readability.

Each word is represented by 12 dots, corresponding to the values:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048

*   `#63 amazing = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32`
    `| ●●●● | ●●○○ | ○○○○ |`
*   `#977 key = 1 + 16 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512`
    `| ●○○○ | ●○●● | ●●○○ |`
*   `#1267 oxygen = 1 + 2 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 1024`
    `| ●●○○ | ●●●● | ○○●○ |`

## SLIP39 Dot Pattern Mapping

SLIP39 is an advanced standard using Shamir's Secret Sharing to divide recovery phrases into multiple fragments (shares) for enhanced security. Unlike BIP39, which generates a single recovery phrase, SLIP39 allows for the creation of a "master secret" that can be split into multiple unique shares. This provides a more robust and flexible backup solution.

### Key Differences from BIP39 and Advantages of SLIP39:

*   **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS):** The primary distinction is SLIP39's integration of SSS. This cryptographic scheme allows a secret to be divided into a number of unique parts (shares), such that a predetermined number of those parts (the threshold) are required to reconstruct the original secret. BIP39 does not offer this functionality.
*   **Enhanced Security:** With SSS, even if some shares are lost or compromised, the master secret remains secure as long as the threshold number of shares is not met. This significantly reduces the risk of single points of failure compared to BIP39, where the compromise of a single recovery phrase means the loss of funds.
*   **Flexible Recovery:** SLIP39 enables users to define custom recovery policies. For example, you can create 5 shares and require any 3 of them to recover the secret (a 3-of-5 scheme). This flexibility is crucial for managing inheritance, multi-signature setups, or distributing risk among trusted individuals.
*   **Resilience to Loss:** Losing one or more shares does not necessarily mean losing access to your funds, as long as the minimum threshold of shares is still available. This adds a layer of fault tolerance.
*   **Multiple Recovery Options:** Users can create different sets of shares for various scenarios, such as a personal set and a family set, each with its own threshold.

### How SLIP39 Works (Example: Word Index 308)

1.  **Find largest number ≤ 308:** 256.
2.  **Subtract:** 308 - 256 = 52.
3.  **Continue with next largest numbers:**
    *   **32:** 52 - 32 = 20.
    *   **16:** 20 - 16 = 4.
    *   **4:** 4 - 4 = 0.
    *   Combination: **256 + 32 + 16 + 4 = 308**.

In the standard (non-reversed) mapping, binary numbers are read from left to right (largest to smallest value).

### Dot Pattern Representation (12 dots)

2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

For instance:

*   `#1 academic = 1`
    `| ○○○○ | ○○○○ | ○○○● |`
*   `#1024 zero = 1024`
    `| ○●○○ | ○○○○ | ○○○○ |`
*   `#496 kernel = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32`
    `| ○○○● | ●●●● | ○○○○ |`
*   `#497 keyboard = 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 1`
    `| ○○○● | ●●●● | ○○○● |`
